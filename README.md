## Project Description

**Project Proposal**

We want our project to focus on college age drinking due to the normalization of binge drinking at college parties that is depicted in the media.  We hope that our research project will show the prevalence of college drinking and possible links between drinking heavily in college and alcoholism later in life.  College drinking is an important health issue because it is strongly tied with college culture, but the extent of alcohol consumption in college oftentimes has devastating affects.These health consequences, both short and long term, are often overlooked. Thus, we hope to highlight potential consequences college drinking entails. We may potentially need to broaden the scope of our project to the effects of alcohol in general due to a lack of raw data available for the use of alcohol by college students.

**Datasets**

- [Drug Use By Age](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/21600/variables?q=alcohol)

This dataset comes from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health which was conducted by the University of Northern Carolina. The dataset was accessed from the ICPSR (a data publication) website. The study lasted from 1994 to 2008 and collected data through in-home interviews and health surveys. The dataset provides a variety of national health data among Americans aged 7-32. Our group will be focusing on data on alcohol use for young adult Americans. This data includes drinking habits, mixing alcohol with other drugs, and alcohol use by age and gender. 

- [Substance Abuse & Mental Health Data Archive](https://pdas.samhsa.gov/#/survey/NSDUH-2018-DS0001?column=ALDAYPWK&control=COLLENRLST&results_received=true&row=DEPNDALC&run_chisq=false&weight=ANALWT_C)

This data came from a survey conducted in 2018 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration. The survey was distributed to people in the United States aged 12 and older. To view the data we selected, you must click crosstab. The control group of this dataset are students enrolled in college. There is a comparison made between alcohol dependency and number of drinks consumed within a week.

**Supplementary Resources**

- [US National Library of Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4708254/)

This article discusses a study of college student drinking habits and the potential consequence that may have occurred.  The study surveyed college students the summer before college and every semester thereafter for four years. The study found that drinking habits were consistently high throughout the four years of college and a majority of those who drink experience some type of consequence that may either be social (like regretting a sexual encounter) or physical (like blacking out).

- [Harvard Alcohol Survey](http://archive.sph.harvard.edu/cas/What-We-Learned-08.pdf)

The Harvard School of Public Health fourteen year long College Alcohol Study (CAS) is summarized in this article. CAS, which started in 1992, was the first alcohol study to seek consumption patterns and the harms of these patterns among college students nationally. The study takes into account both gender and age. The study concluded that the most harm was targeted towards students who binge drink (have five or more drinks in a short sitting), but also discovered that binge drinking levels are not equivalent to five or more drinks for everyone. The study also concluded that over 40% of college students have participated in binge drinking during their college career.

- [NIAAA Factsheet](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/alcohol-facts-and-statistics)

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, or the NIAAA, compiled together a fact sheet of various studies conducted on alcohol consumption by individuals 12 years or older. There is a section, in particular, that covers alcohol and its prevalence in college. According to a 2018 study conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) , “54.9 percent of full-time college students ages 18–22 drank alcohol in the past month compared with 44.6 percent of other persons of the same age” (“Alcohol Facts and Statistics”). This displays that a majority of college students consume alcohol more frequently as compared to those in the same age group of 18-22 who are not attending college. Along with this, “Roughly 20 percent of college students meet the criteria for AUD” (“Alcohol Facts and Statistics”) . Meaning, one-fifth of college students can be designated as having Alcohol Use Disorder, which is a medical term that defines the inability for an individual with dependence on alcohol. It is more simply a more scientific classification of the word “alcoholism.”

- [Positive and negative consequences of alcohol consumption in college students](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460303001199)

This article discusses the negative and positive consequences of alcohol consumption in college. While some college students report negative consequences such as feeling sick and unplanned sexual behaviors are common, others also report positive consequences such as socialization and self expression. One interesting insight was that there are more extreme positive consequences encounters compared to the negative encounters.  Lastly, the study also examines the frequencies of negative and positive consequences of alcohol consumption as well as discuss how the frequencies impact college student’s future drinking decisions. 

**Target Audience**

The main target audience for our dataset is undergraduate college students (ages ~17-22) who are concerned with how their alcohol consumption in college affects their health later in life. This study can help college-aged students weigh the risks of drinking and decide if they want to consume alcohol and if so, how much they want to consume. 

**Result of Research**

In collecting data and research on alcohol consumption by college students, we hope to designate clear impacts of alcohol on young adults ages 17-22. In particular, we are seeking to specifically answer three questions:

- Does the consumption of alcohol by college students increase the risk of alcoholism later in their lives?
- How prevalent is alcohol consumption in college?
- Where in the United States is alcohol consumption by college students most prominent?

Answers and visualizations to the listed questions will determine the most prominent effects of alcohol on these individuals and the geographical locations that are most impacted by college binge drinking. This will allow our primary audience, college students, to make informed decisions about their health. If shown data on risk of alcoholism based on college drinking, there will be more thought put into the amount of alcohol they are consuming.

## Technical Description

**Format of Final Project**

The format of our final project will be a Shiny App. Shiny will provide the ability for our group to create interactive visualizations that will display our findings and research. It will allow our target demographic of college students to navigate data in visually-stimulating and interesting ways. This could include maps, scatterplots, bar plots, and other graphs. 

**Specific Challenges in Data Collection**

There are a few data collection and management challenges we could foresee. The first challenge we could foresee is that despite that there are a lot of data sets on college students' alcohol consumption and drinking behaviors, many dataset websites such as Kaggle are open sourced and it could potentially be a challenge for us to find credible and reliable sources. Another potential data collection challenge is finding enough datasets that allow us to draw accurate correlations between drinking behaviors in colleges and drinking behaviors later in life. In addition, people’s drinking behaviors and personal health over the years are impacted by various factors such as family history and external environment.  We need to be conscious of these factors when looking at how alcohol could impact one’s personal health later in life.

**New Technical Skills**

We decided to use Shiny as the primary platform to build our interactive visualization tool and we discovered that it has been a while since all of us have used Shiny. Therefore, as a group, we need to familiarize ourselves with the basic syntax and the use of Shiny during the initial stages of the project. Other technical skills we need to acquire for this project include languages that help us to draw connections across different datasets and create predictions for one’s alcoholic consumption behaviors later in life. 

**Major General Challenges**

One of the major challenges that we anticipate is being able to collaborate completely remotely. It may be more difficult to ensure that we are all on the same page about our project. Anticipating this challenge, we plan to meet via zoom often and push all of our edits to github. Another major challenge will be finding enough data to compare alcohol consumption in college students to alcoholism later in life.
